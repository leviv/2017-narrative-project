$article = '<p>With more Americans now exercising a legal right to carry firearms, police find themselves having to make rapid judgments about whether an armed citizen is a threat. This dilemma isn\'t a new one. Gun rights groups started a push for more permissive laws in the 1990s, and most states now allow concealed carry, open carry or both.</p>
        <p>And police are divided on the issue: Chiefs tend to favor more gun control, while the younger rank and file tend to support gun rights.</p>
        <p>But even many rank-and-file cops want some limits. Even in states with open carry, when people see someone with a gun, they tend to call the cops — and then the police get the thankless job of challenging someone who may or may not be a threat. One high-ranking officer in Texas calls it a "headache."</p>
        <p>"When you have all these people running around with guns and rifles, you don\'t know who the bad guy is," he says.</p>
        <p>Another potential “headache” is concealed-carry permits and the people, like Joseph Olson of Minnesota, who like to keep their guns secret.</p>
        <p>"Unless it\'s an essential part of what I\'m doing, like defending myself, whether or not I\'m carrying a gun at any given time is something I never say," says Olson, a retired law professor who led the campaign to make his state a concealed-carry state in 2003.</p>
        <p>Legal guns used to be a rarity in the Minnesota, but in recent years the number of permits has jumped, and armed citizens are a routine factor for the police.</p>
        <p>Minnesota law doesn\'t require people to tell police they have a gun unless asked, but cops say they appreciate being told as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Scott Dibble, a state senator from Minneapolis, says he\'s surprised officers haven\'t been given specific training for these situations, and he\'s also concerned that members of the public aren\'t being given clear, consistent instructions on how to inform officers that they\'re armed.</p>
        <p>Dibble favors maximum transparency: "Seems like the right thing to do is to say, \'Officer, I\'m a concealed-carry permit holder, I have a firearm, I don\'t want you to be surprised should you see it.\' "</p>
