$article = '<p>In Wyoming, pot is illegal. Not so in neighboring Colorado, where recreational marijuana is available in a variety of different forms.</p>
<p>The general feeling is that if you bring marijuana legally purchased in Colorado into Wyoming, you\'ll probably get into trouble. But what kind of trouble remains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Wyoming makes 3 ounces of leafy marijuana a felony. Maka Kalai, Director of Sales and Marketing for the Fort Collins, Colo., pot retailer Organic Alternatives, says smoking that much pot would take a long time.</p>
    <p>"It would absolutely take me at least three months, if not six months, to finish 3 ounces of cannabis," he says.</p>
        <p>"The argument has always been that if you have over a certain amount it\'s no longer considered for personal use," explains Laramie Police Chief Dale Stalder. "You must be possessing it in order to sell it to somebody else."</p>
        <p>But if 3 ounces of leafy pot is a lot, 3 ounces of edible pot may seem rather modest once one considers the flour in a brownie, sugar in candies, or water in a beverage.</p>
        <p>The Wyoming legislature will consider two bills this session and neither takes it easy on edibles. One would make 3 ounces of edible marijuana and 36 ounces of liquid marijuana a felony, while the other would maintain 3 ounces as a felony but lessen penalties for first and second offenders.</p>
        <p>The tough stance is because law enforcement sees dangers with edibles. John Knepper of the Wyoming attorney general\'s office says people often eat more than the recommended serving.</p>
        <p>"One of the things that the edible marijuana industry has taught us is that if you want to sell a psychoactive substance, a really effective way is to bundle it with chocolate because that\'s something people like," he says.</p>
        <p>State Rep. Charles Pelkey says the legislature has wasted too much time on the issue and thinks they should move to decriminalize Wyoming\'s marijuana laws.</p>
        <p>"You know," he says, "I haven\'t spent this much time listening to people pointlessly talk about weed since I was in high school."</p>
        <p>The Wyoming legislature will attempt to add more certainty to the issue when it takes up the new proposals next month.</p>
