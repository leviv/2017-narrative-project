$article = '<p>Two undocumented immigrants were detained after leaving a church-run first-aid shelter in Virginia last month, raising concerns among advocates that similar arrests might cause people to avoid getting much-needed help.</p>
        <p>But Immigrations and Customs Enforcement stated that the detainments were a coincidence and that the agency is not targeting churches or other sensitive areas.</p>
        <p>At issue is the agency\'s "sensitive locations policy," which bars agents from searching, interviewing or arresting potential undocumented immigrants in places of worship, hospitals, schools, protests, funerals and weddings. Exceptions can be made for a fast-moving investigation or with prior approval from supervisors.</p>
        <p>Last month’s arrests occurred after the two men had just left a first-aid shelter at Rising Hope Church in Fairfax. But an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement official said that agents were not staking out the church, that they were in the area looking for a specific person and that the men were arrested after "consensual interviews" on a sidewalk in front of a nearby supermarket.</p>
        <p>"The ICE sensitive locations policy provides that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require either prior approval from a supervisory official or exigent circumstances necessitating immediate action," said ICE in a statement. "ICE is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation."</p>
        <p>Immigrations officials have skirted the line on sensitive locations before. In 2016, a teen in North Carolina was arrested while waiting for a school bus not far from his home. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, however, said when he was taken into custody they had no idea he was even at a bus stop, according to a report by the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Advocates worry these arrests will perpetuate fear within anxious immigrant communities. Three dozen protesters affiliated with the Congregations Network gathered at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Fairfax to protest the arrests outside Rising Hope. “The expansion of the aggressiveness, the escalation of immigration enforcement is happening so fast,” said volunteer Mary Smalls. “I know we will be back to protest again, and I know we will have a bigger crowd next time.”</p>
